# How to Upload Videos to GitHub Releases

## Step 1: Create a Release
1. Go to: https://github.com/chitwan101e-ship-it/Juwa2/releases
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Tag: v1.0.0
4. Title: "Video Assets"
5. Description: "Large video files for the website"

## Step 2: Upload Your Videos
Drag and drop these files:
- banner.mp4 (114 MB)
- spinwheel.mp4 (50 MB)
- footer3.mp4
- footer2.mp4
- readytoplay.mp4

## Step 3: Publish Release
Click "Publish release"

## Step 4: Get URLs
After publishing, each video will have a URL like:
`https://github.com/chitwan101e-ship-it/Juwa2/releases/download/v1.0.0/banner.mp4`

Copy these URLs and I'll update the code to use them.
